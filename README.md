# Liars-Dice

### 9/20 (In Class)
  - Fixed opponent difficulty errors
  - Implemented varying opponents into game & user input
  - Need to add "dummy cases" for invalid user input

### 9/22
  - Optimized clearConsole() as I didnâ€™t understand what it really did from research code found online
  - Still need to add "dummy cases" as well as invalid checks for dice
